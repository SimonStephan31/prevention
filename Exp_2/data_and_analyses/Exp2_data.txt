There is also the chance that the thinner was not the treatment that worked but perhaps the bodies coping mechanisms were very effective in compensating for the artery being blocked.	He didn't fall into the comma perhaps due to the skill and experience of the surgeon avoiding blocking the artery that leads to the comma and this success had nothing to do with the use of the thinner. The other possibility is that maybe the complication did occur in this patient but the person monitoring/observing for this complication missed it.	11	9	2	1	25	1	-99	1148

Without the context of the other results its impossible to see if any patients lapsed into a coma without a complication occurring - with or without the blood thinner. Because of this it wouldnt be possible to conclude that the blood thinner he received played no part in his not lapsing into a coma; despite how unlikely it might seem that the patient would lapse into a coma following no complications, if this is a finding based on results alone and not human opinion of what is likely or unlikely, without the whole study it cannot be conclusive.	11	6	6	1	38	2	-99	1495

558	strong	attack_first	1	1	2	1	11	No patient who has been treated with blood thinning has fallen into a permanent coma. Therefore, the blood thinners are 100% effective in preventing this issue. However, since the complication still occurred in some cases - it leads me believe that the incorrect dose of blood thinning medication was used on these patients, or perhaps they have preexisting conditions related to their blood, which the doctors did not factor. In any case, it still does not change the fact that the blood thinning medication prevents patients falling into comas.	I'm unsure whether the blood thinning treatment is used to prevent the complication from occurring, or to prevent the complication from leading to a permanent coma.     If the treatment is used to prevent the complication from leading to a coma; then the blood thinners did not help this patient, as they did not give any complications.     If the blood thinning is used to prevent a complication; then the blood thinning is what gave this patient a successful surgery.	11	11	6	1	25	1	-99	1631

I am confident that if looking at the experiment objectively and not taking into account any of these other factors that is was the blood thinners that prevented this patient from going into a coma because all subjects from the placebo group who experienced the complication went into a coma. Adversely, all subjects who received the blood thinner and experienced the complication did not go into a coma. I believe it is still inherently correlation but with replication could find causation.	The patient did not experience the complication, making it almost impossible to suggest that they did not go into a coma because of the blood thinner. They didn't go into a coma because the complication did not occur as the occurrence of said complication is needed to measure the outcome.	11	10	1	1	20	2	-99	1163

Had the patient not experienced any complications, I would be able to come to the conclusion that he/she avoided the permanent coma due to his/her taking of the blood thinners.	I am confident that taking the blood thinners helped the patient avoid falling into a coma because the patient did not experience any complications during the surgery and he/she did not fall into a coma.

I chose 90% sure because I suppose there is always a margin of error, or surgeon skill level variances, etc. The overwhelming evidence presented to me points to the fact that the blood thinner does work in preventing comas during this surgery.	The confidence level is lower because the complication did not occur, therefore the blood thinner hypothesis was not really tested in the same way as the previous question. However, the evidence still suggests that the blood thinner worked as a preventative in my opinion.	11	10	8	1	28	1	-99	745

In addition, all patients with thinner and complication were prevented from coma (all green circles irrespective of complication occurring).  However, for every complication without thinner, the patient experienced coma (every grey circle has a red ring, suggesting complication always led to coma), there are no occurrences of complication without coma, or no complication with coma when no thinner is given.  This appears to suggest thinner is a good preventative measure in case the complication occurs.  I did not choose certain because of the limited sample size - more data would increase certainty (if the results are repeated!)

As the complication did not occur, it is impossible to say that the blood thinner was responsible for the success.	8	8	1	1	49	1	-99	1548
491	weak	attack_first	1	1	2	1	10	From the data gathered by the study we see a total avoidance of comas among patients who fall into a coma. It very strongly suggests that the use of a blood thinner helps eliminate the risk of coma among those who suffer the complication during surgury.	Since the usual cause of coma after this surgery is the artery-blocking complication and this patient wasn't affected by that, it's unlikely that the use of blood thinners was related to his successful outcome.	10	10	3	1	35	2	-99	495
494	weak	attack_first	1	1	2	1	7	100% of patients who received the blood thinner and had complications did not lapse into a coma as a result.	50 % of the patients who received the blood thinner still had complications during surgery, although they did not fall into a coma as a result. Patient 55 did not have any complications during surgery.	11	11	6	1	47	1	-99	1215
507	weak	attack_first	1	1	2	1	6	According to thoe results from those who took the placebo, only 50% of those who had complications fell into a coma so it could be that Patient 53 would have been one of those who naturally wouldn't have fallen into the coma but equally it could be the blood thinner that prevented this.	According to the results of those who had the placebo, only the people who had complications fell into a coma. Patient 55 didn't have complications so it is more likely that the skill of the surgeon that prevented the patient from doing so.	10	6	1	1	62	1	No, all was good	989
522	weak	attack_first	1	1	2	1	9	I would not like to be 100% sure because I think more people need to be tested. I am actually not 100% sure that the complication the patient had could have led to a coma but I think based on clinic B it seems most complications lead to a coma which is why I leaned towards yes for this question.	I think it is a combination of the fact that the patient did not have a complication and received the blood thinner.	10	10	6	1	31	2	-99	952
526	weak	attack_first	1	1	2	1	3	Because none of the patients in this group lapsed into a coma compared to 25% in the other group so I think it's very likely this was because of the blood thinner	The same reason as before although I think the chances are reduced as the complication didn't occur anyway.	11	10	8	1	57	2	None	772
537	weak	attack_first	1	1	2	1	10	In comparison with the placebo group where everyone that had a complication died, this blood thinners taken in patient 53's group obviously made a difference. THere were complications yet no one died	The complication which creates a need for the blood thinner did not happen in this case. Patient 55 would have lived even in the placebo group as there was no complication during their surgery	10	10	1	1	28	2	-99	879
545	weak	attack_first	1	1	2	1	6	No patients in the group fell in to a permanent coma after the thinner compared to the many the didn't have the thinner so the thinner looks effective in it's prevention.	There are other factors, was the patient generally healthier than others before?	10	9	8	1	37	2	n/a	486
554	weak	attack_first	1	1	2	1	7	Based on the previous slide, it's likely that the blood thinner reduced risk of falling into a permanent coma - but there are other factors at play (e.g. the patient's holistic health etc), so I can't be totally confident.	I don't know, because the complication didn't occur.	11	9	6	1	31	2	No technical issues!	563
556	weak	attack_first	1	1	2	1	8	Patient 53 is shown to have been given the blood thinner and although there was a complication the patient did not lapse into a coma. This would suggest that it was because of the blood thinner that no coma happened therfore I opted for the 100% response that it was because of the thinner.	Don't think it is certain this time. Perhaps without the thinner the patient would have experienced no problems anyway. I have opted for 50/50 as I don't think we can prove it was because of the thinner as there were no complications with the surgery	11	11	6	1	52	1	-99	946
561	weak	attack_first	1	1	2	1	6	none of the cohort who received the blood thinner ended up in a coma even if a complication occurred, therefore the blood thinner 100% prevents coma even if there are complications during surgery	The reason why he did not lapse into a coma was because the complication did not occur	11	11	1	1	53	2	-99	882
569	weak	attack_first	1	1	2	1	9	Based on the evidence it would suggest that the blood thinner prevents patients going into a coma, however it has been proved in the other study that patients who have complications do not go into a coma therefore I can not be 100% certain that the blood thinner prevented the coma.	People with no complications during surgery do not fall into comas therefore the blood thinner had no bearing.	11	9	1	1	42	2	NA	434
587	weak	attack_first	1	1	2	1	6	Some of the patients in the placebo group had the complication during their surgery and didn't lapse into a coma, showing that it is possible for coma to be avoided in some cases when the complication occurs and the patient hasn't taken the drug. It is possible that the drug prevented coma in this patient, but I think it is equally possible that coma was avoided due to some other factor unrelated to the blood thinner.	The information provided earlier in the study stated that the coma usually occurs when the complication occurs during their surgery. This patient didn't have the complication, so the risk factor the blood thinner protects against wasn't present and therefore wasn't avoided due to them taking the drug.	11	6	1	1	32	2	-99	640
596	weak	attack_first	1	1	2	1	8	Because from the result shown in the pictures above all who received the blood thinner before the surgery did not fall into comma.	there was no complication yes probably due to the blood thinner he received before surgery but I am not 100 percent sure about it	11	11	9	1	28	2	n/a	1117
598	weak	attack_first	1	1	2	1	6	The patient was just as likely to experience the complication during surgery, however they were 50% less likely to fall into a coma due to the blood thinner.	0% of patients receiving the blood thinner, fell into a coma.	11	6	11	1	36	1	Slight lag	959
636	weak	attack_first	1	1	2	1	8	Looking at all the results of group A shows me that the blood thinner works to prevent permanent Coma, The complications happened but they never went in to coma	Not sure 100% sure if it was the blood thinner because there was no complications during the operation	11	11	8	1	50	1	-99	1165
645	weak	attack_first	1	1	2	1	7	Nobody in the trial who experienced the complication lapsed into a coma.	They might have been fine otherwise due to the fact that the complication didn't occur.	10	10	7	1	40	2	-99	666
665	weak	attack_first	1	1	2	1	8	Because there is a chance that they would have not gotten a coma anyways (looking at the non blood thinner group) but every single person (regardless of having a complication) didn't have a coma so I think think the blood thinner helped	Most patients don't go into a coma so in his case I think it's half and half	10	8	6	1	19	2	-99	2275
670	weak	attack_first	1	1	2	1	3	I am confident in this decision as the ones who did take a blood thinner; none of them fell into a coma despite the complication occurring. The ones who took a placebo, a lot of the patients fell into a coma when this complication happened.	It is truly hard to say whether the blood thinner prevented this, but those who took a placebo had more chance of falling into a coma so I feel more confident that this was due to the blood thinner.	9	9	8	1	23	2	-99	475
671	weak	attack_first	1	1	2	1	8	It seems odds are higher that if you have the blood thinner, that they do not lapse into a coma as those who had the thinner had no complications or if they did they did not end up in a coma like the people with the placebo	Again it seems the blood thinner prevents the coma stage and also reduces the danger of lapsing into a coma	6	10	10	1	56	2	-99	747
690	weak	attack_first	1	1	2	1	10	There is a possibility that the if the patient hadn't had the blood thinner he would have lapsed into a coma but not necessarily as there were other patients who had the complications, didn't have blood thinner and didn't lapse into a coma	Because the blood thinner has a potential impact on individuals possibility of lapsing into a coma if they have the complication. It is associated with that relationship not any others therefore the blood thinner would not have much influence on this patient as they didn't have the complication	9	9	2	1	22	2	-99	678
692	weak	attack_first	1	1	2	1	5	I think it is pretty certain but nothing can be 100% certain - I think the chance of it being certain is high though because of the unbiased nature of the study	I'm not sure because the complication did not happen and they did not fall into a coma	11	9	6	1	29	2	-99	487
695	weak	attack_first	1	1	2	1	5	They were part of the bigger group of whom had taken the blood thinner and results were more positive.  The majority of the people either had no complications but the ones who did did not lapse into a coma.	This person was part of the bigger group who did not lapse into a coma.	8	8	9	1	47	2	-99	1520
701	weak	attack_first	1	1	2	1	7	There was a chance that the patient wouldnt have lapsed into a coma without the thinner. This chance is greatly increased with the use of the blood thinner but cannot say its perfect as it should still be a chance outcome	None of the patients who had the placebo and had no complications lapsed into a coma so it cannot be said that the thinner had any effect	11	8	1	1	51	1	-99	965
706	weak	attack_first	1	1	2	1	8	patients who didnt receive blood thinner were more likely to fall into permanent coma	patients who receive placebo were more likely to fall into coma	8	8	7	1	24	2	-99	1028
721	weak	attack_first	1	1	2	1	6	From the results displayed it is around a 50:50 split between people that fall into a permanent coma. Whilst the blood thinner improves the chances it is only around a 50% change	The blood thinner has helped and the surgeon has also avoided damaging an artery	6	6	9	1	33	1	-99	624
733	weak	attack_first	1	1	2	1	3	Although there's still a slim chance for the patient to not fall into a coma when the complication occurs after not having received the thinner, they will always not go into a coma after receiving the thinner.	Theres not much of a way to know since the complication didn't occur	11	9	6	1	20	1	-99	334
734	weak	attack_first	1	1	2	1	5	In the placebo set of data, when the complication occurs, patients fall into a coma more often than not. This didn't happen at all in the first set of data, therefore the blood thinner was likely to have had an effect and prevented the coma with the patient. However it's not certain as there were several that received the placebo, had the complication but did not fall into a coma.	It probably wasn't because of the blood thinner, because the complication did not occur, it was much less likely that the patient would fall into a coma. However there were patients that received the placebo who fell into a coma without having had the complication, so it could have been preventative.	10	8	5	1	26	2	n/a	836
743	weak	attack_first	1	1	2	1	5	Because of the patient is marked with a green dot surrounded by a red circle and was in the blood thinner group	green dot and in blood thinner group	11	11	11	1	50	1	none	665
745	weak	attack_first	1	1	2	1	10	It seems like the blood thinner is very effective at preventing the coma but sometimes people will have a complication and still not have a coma after.	There was no complication so the blood thinner had no effect	10	8	1	1	21	1	-99	413
748	weak	attack_first	1	1	2	1	9	because there are no Ps in the first trial who lapsed into a permanent coma after the complication however there are Ps in the second trial who did. However, the sample size being only 126 means we can't be completely certain that the blood thinner is 100% reliable to prevent the coma, especially with some of the Ps in the second placebo trial not going into a coma with the complications still occurring.	He didn't have complications and therefore it's the result of the surgeon rather than the result of the blood thinner because the blood thinner is a preventative measure encase of complications rather than to prevent complications. As no complications occurred it wasn't necessary and therefore didn't help them avoid the coma.	9	9	1	1	18	2	-99	606
749	weak	attack_first	1	1	2	1	1	I know nothing about Patient 53 so cannot determine what caused him to avoid falling into a coma.	Again, I do not know anything about the patient so cannot determine why they did or didn't fall into a coma.	5	6	6	1	27	2	-99	590
762	weak	attack_first	1	1	2	1	1	i looked at all patients in the placebo group who experienced a complication and 50% of them did not lapse into a coma as a result.  So patient 53 may have been in either group before we consider the effect of the blood thinner, there is only a 50% chance that the blood thinner an effect on the outcome	60 of the 120 patients in the placebo group had the same outcome as patient 55 - no complication and no permanent coma. However where there was a complication in the placebo group, in 60 of the cases, 30 of these lapsed into a permanent coma.  So the blood thinner is mainly effective in stopping the patients who experience complications in surgery from lapsing into a coma.  Patient 55 had no complications so the blood thinner did not affect his outcome	11	6	1	1	56	2	none	1367
365	weakest	attack_first	1	1	2	1	3	On the previous page it was learnt that about 70% of the time patients that experienced complications during surgery did not lapse into a coma afterwards without having taken blood thinners. Therefore, in the case of patient 53, they may not have slipped into a coma because of this find or because of the blood thinner they took. It's a 50:50 chance either of these situations were to be the cause for not going into a coma.	The patient didn't have a complication during surgery so the blood thinner had no play in preventing a coma afterwards	11	6	1	1	20	2	no	750
373	weakest	attack_first	1	1	2	1	4	The entire group A received the blood thinner prior to surgery. Even though some of the patients encountered complications, none of them lapsed into a coma, including patient 53. In comparison to the other group that (unknowingly) received a placebo, the first test group overcame their complications with a clean slate, leading me to believe it was because of the thinner and not pure luck.	Seeing as the patients in group A did not fall into comas, it is safe to believe that it was as a result of the blood thinner. Even though patient 55 did not have complications to lead up to the lapse, evidence suggests he/she would have overcome them either way. As such, the thinner may have contributed to the patients lack of complications to begin with.	11	11	11	1	31	2	There were no technical issues during my study.	1794
383	weakest	attack_first	1	1	2	1	4	Out of the patients that received placebo, there was a 30% chance of those that faced complications to lapse into a coma afterwards, but of those that did receive blood thinners, none of them lapse into a coma. This gives me the confidence level that the blood thinner had highly likely prevented coma in the group that received blood thinners.	In the group that received blood thinners, none of them had lapsed into a coma, however in the group that received the placebo, around 25% of them had lapsed into a coma. So my conclusion is that the use of blood thinners do have prevention of coma.	3	10	11	1	44	2	-99	1350
386	weakest	attack_first	1	1	2	1	4	It seemed likely that the blood thinner was an important factor as around a third of the placebo group who suffered the complication lapsed into a coma and none of the test group did. I cannot say it certainly was the cause as in the placebo group there were some who did not lapse into a coma after suffering the complication so there may be other factors at play also.	As the patient did not suffer the complication, his chance of not going into a coma was good and I do not know what effect the blood thinner has on a non-complication surgery.	11	9	4	1	32	2	-99	544
398	weakest	attack_first	1	1	2	1	6	Because some patients don't lapse into a coma after the complication but with the blood thinner no patients lapse into coma	Because the complication that causes patients to lapse into come did not occur	11	8	2	1	50	2	-99	690
403	weakest	attack_first	1	1	2	1	10	A complication indeed did occur after surgery but because patient 53 had taken a blood thinner it reduced the chances of him or her falling into a coma hence I have chosen the level above.	Patient 55 had taken a blood thinner prior to surgery which secured and prevented him or her from a possible state of coma. It was absolutely gauranteed that he or she would not fall into a coma.	7	7	11	1	19	2	I did not expirience any technical issues and was delighted to participate in the survey.	800
415	weakest	attack_first	1	1	2	1	9	The data shows that none of the patients who were given the blood thinner fell in a permanent coma, but on a bigger scale this could be slightly less.	No complications occurred, so the blood thinner would've helped with this.	10	10	11	1	18	2	-99	822
426	weakest	attack_first	1	1	2	1	6	In the placebo grup, about 1 in 3 of those who had the complication went into coma - meaning 2/3 who had the complication did not. This was prevented in the treatment group, where the same proportion of patients had the compliction. So we can expect that it reduces the risk by 1/3	none of those in the placebo group who had the same outcome, experienced the complication. So it seems likely that the thinner affects the complication, which then affects the likelihood of coma. It is unlikely that the thinner was responsible for the outcome. However, we cannot be sure... hence my answer	7	4	2	1	52	1	-99	777
428	weakest	attack_first	1	1	2	1	8	in comparison with the placebo group. Many in the placebo group suffered the complication and did not go into a coma.	A similar number in the placebo group also did not have complication, or coma.	11	8	8	1	45	1	-99	558
448	weakest	attack_first	1	1	2	1	7	Because nobody who took the thinner fell into a coma, yet a high proportion of people who didn't fell into one. However, there were still some people that were fine although they didn't take the thinner, therefore it might not be because of the thinner that patient 53 didn't have a coma.	Nobody who took the thinner had a coma so this is why I think person 55 didn't have one.	11	9	10	1	19	2	-99	439
455	weakest	attack_first	1	1	2	1	8	Those who never took the blood thinner were clearer at a higher risk of falling into a permanent coma. This patient despite experiencing a complication during surgery never fell into a coma and one of the possible explanations is the fact they took the blood thinner.	There was no complication so it's unlikely that the blood thinner had any effect here on coma prevention.	9	9	4	1	28	1	-99	844
465	weakest	attack_first	1	1	2	1	6	I do not know other factors, but this patient had complications but did not fall into a coma. Looking other at only this patient, I cannot know if this was because of the blood thinners or not.	The complication may have been prevented by the blood thinner, or there may have been no chance of the complication anyway.	11	8	6	1	36	2	-99	680
470	weakest	attack_first	1	1	2	1	4	Not all patients who received the blood thinner had the complication, so the complication arising as a result of the blood thinner isn't 100% certain either, hence why it has a very high (but not certain) rating.	The complication causes patients to lapse into a coma. This could be down to blood thinner or other contributing factors (there are another 20 or so patients who also experienced the same outcome), hence the uncertainty in my response.	11	10	6	1	33	2	-99	747
471	weakest	attack_first	1	1	2	1	4	Because it looks like the normal rate for the complication leading to a permanent coma is about 1/3	The complication didn't occur, therefore the blood thinner didn't matter in this case.	11	4	1	1	31	1	no	380
478	weakest	attack_first	1	1	2	1	6	Not everyone who has a complication will fall in to a coma, therefore we do not know if they did not fall in to a coma due to the blood thinner.	There were no complications and therefore the blood thinner would not have made any difference as no one without complications fell in to a coma so the blood thinner would have made no difference..	11	6	1	1	43	2	-99	704
485	weakest	attack_first	1	1	2	1	3	The blood thinner certainly makes it much more likely that the patient will avoid coma after complication	Judging from the amount of patients that suffered from a coma without receiving blood thinners, it seems probable that the blood thinners had a positive effect on this patient.	11	9	8	1	33	2	-99	-1
498	weakest	attack_first	1	1	2	1	5	There were roughly 25 more people in the other group who had a complication and went into a coma.	Nothing happened in the surgery to cause a coma.	4	4	3	1	47	2	-99	942
510	weakest	attack_first	1	1	2	1	5	Based on the evidence of the overall study I think the blood thinner was responsible, but I have to leave a margin of error just in case	It's highly likely, but again, there is a margin of error in case of doubt	11	9	9	1	31	1	-99	847
524	weakest	attack_first	1	1	2	1	9	From the data it seems the drug is successful in preventing coma even when complications arise during surgery.	It is difficult to say whether the drug was effective or if the patient would have been fine without the drug anyway.	11	9	6	1	52	2	-99	706
533	weakest	attack_first	1	1	2	1	7	Because not all of the patients who did not receive the blood thinner and then went on to experience complications, lapsed into a permanent coma.	The complication did not occur for this patient, therefore they did not lapse into a coma.	11	6	1	1	50	2	-99	677
536	weakest	attack_first	1	1	2	1	7	I feel like from looking at the group that didn't have the thinner there is still a high chance that they can  have complications but no coma eeven without the thinner	No complications occurred	11	5	4	1	34	2	-99	636
540	weakest	attack_first	1	1	2	1	6	Complications can occur without blood thinners and not lead to a coma however in the cases with the blood thinner it stops the comas giving a higher chance of not	they did not have the complication	11	8	1	1	19	1	-99	431
563	weakest	attack_first	1	1	2	1	8	In the no-control group individual had a 60% chance of having complications and not going into a coma and having the blood thinner showed that the likelihood of coma was none existent in the sample.	The patient had no complication, so did not need the blood thinner.	11	9	1	1	34	1	-99	1466
566	weakest	attack_first	1	1	2	1	7	The lodd thinners would have helped the patience but other factors could've contributed to why the patient did not fall into a coma	the blood thinners would have helped but this patient also had no complications during surgery	11	8	9	1	42	2	-99	749
577	weakest	attack_first	1	1	2	1	8	Because everyone who received the thinner did not fall into a coma.	In this case, he did not get the complication that would result in a coma, regardless of whether or not he got the thinner	11	11	6	1	58	2	-99	555
585	weakest	attack_first	1	1	2	1	4	From the results, there is never a case where someone does get to have a complication during the surgery. thus, this led me to think that of those complications that occurred, the blood thinner prevented them	There are as many patients in A as in B who did not experience complications, thus its less likely that the thinner increases one`s chances from not experiencing the complication at all (the complication has to occur for the thinner to be significant)	11	11	3	1	24	1	Nope	1527
593	weakest	attack_first	1	1	2	1	11	as the study showed in the patients that the complication occurred, every one who received the blood thinner did not go into a coma, whilst the ones without it did	this was because the patient did not experience the complication that could lead to a coma	11	11	1	1	34	2	-99	239
605	weakest	attack_first	1	1	2	1	4	Both groups had a 80% turnout of experiencing the complication however not a single patient in group 1 lapsed into a coma whereas about 25% of patients in group 2 fell into a coma after experiencing the complication.	The blood thinner may have made it easier for the surgeon to perform the surgery but the complication didn't occur at all which may have been the reason for not lapsing instead of the blood thinner.	11	11	8	1	18	2	-99	1284
616	weakest	attack_first	1	1	2	1	7	The patient received the blood thinner and didn't lapse into a coma after a complication occurring, compared with the number of patients that did not receive the thinner and did lapse into a coma leads me to believe that the thinner had an impact on this. Plus, taking into account the overall data, I feel this is sufficiently backed up by the data.	It's hard to tell if the thinner had an impact as the patient did not experience a complication.	11	9	6	1	41	1	-99	1094
624	weakest	attack_first	1	1	2	1	4	It seems unlikely given that a lot of people who never had the blood thinner also experienced complications, it's obviously an extremely complex surgery	I do think the blood thinner has been extremely effective at preventing the coma, however this patient may not have fallen into a coma anyway	11	3	7	1	35	2	-99	367
634	weakest	attack_first	1	1	2	1	6	I am confident  it was due to the blood thinners that the patient didn't lapse into a coma. This is based on the results of all the patients who received the blood thinners, then had complications during surgery and went on to make a recovery. The chart suggests that in 100% of cases, those who suffered with complications during surgery, but who had the blood thinners, didn't lapse into a coma.	There was no complication during the surgery, so it is difficult to tell whether the blood thinners were effective in this case.	11	9	6	1	36	2	-99	1053
635	weakest	attack_first	1	1	2	1	6	i have given this confidence level because in the group that took the blood thinner nobody lapsed into a coma, however you can't always guarantee that this will be the case so i have given an 80% rating,	Again, you can never be 100% sure that this was due to the blood thinner, as some people in the placebo group also did not fall into a coma or experience the complication, however with fairly high confidence you can say the blood thinner helped.	10	9	9	1	31	1	-99	567

654	weakest	attack_first	1	1	2	1	7	The reason I gave my answer for the last question was because even though some patients would have a complication during surgery, they never went into a permanent coma, where as patients that only received the placebo had the same chance at getting the same complications but also had a much higher risk of going into a permanent coma	I believe since the patient did not have any complications during the surgery, that the chances of them falling into a permeant coma were short to begin with, although I do believe that the blood thinner helped.	9	10	8	1	24	1	none	524

There is no way of telling if the blood thinner had an effect on this patent as looking at the other study patients also had no complications during the surgery and didn't take the blood thinner.	11	6	6	1	33	1	no	848
678	weakest	attack_first	1	1	2	1	6	From the scores it clearly shows that taking the blood thinner can help prevent a permanent coma as no one went in to a permanent coma when taking the blood thinners, compared to the ones that only took the placebo, resulting in many permanent comas. What we don't know is wether it was because of the blood thinner that particular patient did not go into a permanent coma after surgery. But the success rate is much higher with the blood thinners, so this is definitely gives a higher success rate for the surgerys.

750	strong	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	11	I am certain that the patient avoided permanent coma due to the blood thinner because we can see that 100% of patients who had a complication during their surgery and did not receive a blood thinner fell into a coma. Therefore, I have reason to believe that there is a 0% probability that you can have a complication occur without blood thinner and still avoid permanent coma. Hence, the avoidance of coma was certainly due to the blood thinner.	The patient did not fall into a permanent coma because the complication (i.e. blocking of the artery) did not occur. I gave the answer 'certainly wasn't' because there have been no cases of patients falling into a coma without having suffered from the complication, either in the blood thinner trial or in the placebo trial and hence I have no reason to think that there is any chance of a coma resulting from a case with no complication. Therefore, patient would not have fallen into a coma whether or not they received the blood thinner.	11	11	1	1	20	2	-99	521

Therefore there is a 50% chance the complication would not have occurred anyway.	Ignoring problems with randomisation and demographics in the trial, the blood thinner appears to only prevent coma in patients who experience the complication. The patient did not experience the complication therefore the blood thinner had no effect.	10	6	1	1	29	1	-99	670
401	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	5	The surgeon did block the artery.  When the artery is blocked falling into a coma is likely but not definite.  Taking the blood thinner prevents coma 100% but not having the blood thinner gives a much higher change of going into a coma.  It is likely the blood thinner prevented coma but this patient may have not fallen into a coma anyway.	The surgeon did not block the artery with patient 55 so it is not possible to tell what effect the blood thinner had.  As the complication did not occur the patient did not go into a coma.	11	9	1	1	43	2	None	569
416	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	9	Although some patients in the placebo group did not lapse into a coma after the complication, many did, so it stands to reason that the blood thinner had a high chance of helping this patient avoid the coma.	It wasn't the blood thinner because the complication did not occur and so the thinner was irrelevant. No patients in the placebo trial fell into a coma without the complication occurring suggesting that the complication is the only reason for coma.	10	9	1	1	27	2	-99	388
418	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	7	While it's likely the blood thinner helped, this patient had a chance of surviving even without the blood thinner so it's hard to say whether or not the blood thinner played a particularly large role in protecting them.	As the patient did not encounter the complication it is hard to say whether or not they avoided it due to the blood thinner or just due to natural reasons. It appears that the blood thinner does not lower the chances of the complication but only of the coma, so it may have had an effect but it would be difficult for me to say.	11	9	3	1	22	1	-99	640
435	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	6	Without the blood thinner the patient had a 50/50 chance of going into a coma. So it is impossible to know whether the blood thinner actually prevented the coma.	The coma is attributed to the complication (which is something the surgeon accidentally does). So if the complication does not occur, then the results suggest the coma cannot occur. Therefore the blood thinner has no affect either way if the complication does not occur.   This is supported by the results. (In the placebo group there were no patients that lapsed into a coma without the complication taking place.  Complication = 50% chance of coma).	11	6	1	1	46	2	-99	1984
439	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	6	in comparison to the placebo group, many who had the the complications went into a coma but the group issued with blood thinners had no one in a coma though there were complications	Based on the 120 people who were chosen, no one had a permanent coma however, the sample size is is too small and there are many other factors that will need to be controlled in order to come to the conclusion that blood thinners were the reason why no one had a permanent coma. Based on the evidence above it is safe to allude that the blood thinner is key to preventing a permanent coma.	8	8	8	1	19	1	-99	953
443	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	9	For the patients who did not get the thinner, if they got the complication there was a high chance that they went into a coma, but not all the time (maybe 80%?).  Therefore there is a high likelihood that this patient would have fallen into a coma if they didnt receive the blood thinner but they may also have been one of the few who did not go into a coma without a blood thinner.	Because patients in both conditions had a roughly equal chance of having the complication, but only those who did not get the blood thinner had a chance of then falling into a coma.  Therefore, the blood thinner does not appear to stop the complication, but only the coma.	11	9	2	1	29	2	-99	604
447	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	1	It seems that the blood thinner makes the chance of falling into a permanent coma, after a complication in the surgery, significantly lower. This individual received a complication, thus the the thinner aided in his recovery.	the blood thinner helps with if a blood artery is blocked, and if there is a complication during the surgery, to help in the prevention of a coma. It seems to not aid in preventing complications. There wasn't a complication during the surgery and thus the blood thinners wasn't the reason for the success of the surgery	11	9	3	1	19	1	-99	1018
457	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	6	The results show that no patient went into a coma after having received the blood thinner. Although there are some patients who didn't have the blood thinner were able to avoid a coma after they had complications in their surgery, the fact that zero patients on blood thinners went into a coma suggest that the blood thinner almost guarantees them not going into a coma.	As I understand it, the blood thinner is effective if there is a complication in the patient's surgery and so as patient 55 did not have any complications, the fact that he/she did not go into a coma was not to do with the blood thinner but the fact that his/her surgery had no complications.	11	9	1	1	36	2	No. I had no technical problems.	1323
469	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	7	It is likely helped by the blood thinner however there are people in the placebo group with the same result and they hadnt received the blood thinner.	None of the patients in either study lapsed into a coma when the complication did not occur, as the complication didnt occur for patient 55 it is highly unlikely he wouldve lapsed into a coma. However, there is always a chance and these are only the results of one sample.	10	8	2	1	20	2	-99	523
476	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	6	The second study suggested that there was a 50:50 chance of not falling into a coma after the complication occurred anyway, so it is possible that even without the blood thinner they would have not suffered a permanent coma.	No, he likely didn't fall into a coma because he didn't have the complication to begin with.	10	6	2	1	27	2	-99	831
477	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	6	Complication occurred, with no coma	The complication did not occur - the blood thinner, as I understand it, prevents coma when the complication occurs	11	11	1	1	41	1	-99	338
500	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	4	In this instance, complications arose during surgery however the patient didn't lapse into a coma. It is a high possibility that the blood thinners helped in preventing the coma.	I chose 50/50 because other factors could also have prevented the patient from having no complication and thus not lapsing into a permanent coma. One such factor is that the Lord was protecting I'm during surgery.	6	8	6	1	45	2	-99	1037
508	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	11	The complication occurred but most likely the blood thinner administered prior to the surgery helped prevent the patients from lapsing into a permanent coma.

514	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	6	From the placebo group, I can see that there is a 50/50 chance of coma after the complication so I think it has something to do with chance as well as the blood thinner	the risk of falling into a coma comes from the complication occurring, but that did not happen to patient 55	11	10	1	1	30	2	-99	501

542	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	4	As some patients in the placebo group experienced the complication but did not end up in a coma, it is clear that this outcome is possible without a blood thinner, therefore whilst it appears likely the blood thinner reduces chances, we cannot be sure that it the blood thinner causes the lack of coma.	There is little way to prove the coma was prevented as a result the blood thinner as clearly, by the results of the placebo group, patients can experience the complication without the resulting coma, so it is possible that in the study using blood thinner, the patients with the complication experienced this in the same way as those in the placebo group with the compilation who did not fall into a coma. It is likely, looking at the successful results of the blood thinner group, that the treatment does prevent the coma, however we cannot be certain.	10	9	9	1	21	2	-99	852
543	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	8	There is never a definitive chance, but looking at the other results the thinner does make a clear difference. he could have been one of those patients it doesn't effect tho	There is never a 100% chance of something like that happening, but there is a good chance the thinner could have helped prevent a clot which could have caused complications	11	8	3	1	34	1	-99	469
552	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	7	Most of the ones in the placebo group who did have the complication went on to be in a coma - therefore the effect of the thinner is stronger - but since if this person hadn't had the thinner they might not have gone into coma we can't say for definite their result was because of the thinner.	About half would have gone into coma regardless of blood thinner, so we don't know for definite that this one didn't because of the thinner.  However, looking at what happens to similar people who don't get the thinner, it prevents all (in this sample - not definite it would apply to everyone in future) who would have done, had they not had the thinner.  Therefore we can't say for sure that it was as a result of the thinner - they might have been one of the half that wouldn't have gone into coma anyway - but there is a roughly equal chance that it was as a result of the the the thiner.	11	9	6	1	57	2	-99	923
553	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	8	I think the same as in the previous question. Although we also take into account the fact that each organism is different, the above research results show that in 100% none of the patients who were given blood thinner and fell into a coma. It is possible that his body was so weak that complications occurred, but due to blood thinner he did not fall into a coma	Since the patients to whom it was administered, none of them fell into a coma, so there is a very high probability that it was due to blood thinner	11	9	10	1	19	2	-99	850
555	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	6	The blood thinner certainly helped his chances of not being in a coma	As no one who received the blood thinner fell into a coma then patient 55 couldn't fall into a coma based purely on that fact. He may never have fallen into the coma as the complication didn't occur so in some ways the blood thinner was irrelevant to that particular case but by having the blood thinner not falling into a coma became a certainty.	11	9	9	1	55	2	-99	2507
575	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	5	Same as before, since none of the people that received blood thinner leaped into a coma. That is what makes me confident in my answers.

586	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	8	Many of the patients in the other hospital who had complications did fall into a coma, but none of the patients in this hospital did. Just like in my last written answer, correlation does not equal causation, hence why my answer is not the farthest to the right, but it seems like theres a high chance that the blood thinner prevented the coma.	It seems as if all the patients that received the blood thinner did not go into a coma afterwards. My answer is somewhat between 50:50 and  It certainly was because of the blood thinner  because although the results seem to prove that the blood thinner works, correlation does not equal causation, meaning that we can not be 100% that the blood thinners do not ensure that the patient does not fall into a coma.	9	9	9	1	20	2	No	635

601	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	8	I would now say that I am a bit more confident that it was to do with the blood thinner because the complication did happen but the patient didn't go into a coma. Obviously there is a chance the patient would have avoided the permanent coma without the drug, so I'm not 100% confident	I would say this patient not going into a coma is less likely due to the blood thinner because the complication never occurred. If this was a patient where the complication occurred but they still didn't go into a coma i would be a bit more confident that it was due to the blood thinner.	10	7	3	1	22	2	N/A	634
609	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	6	Compared to the results of the patients that did not take the blood thinner, The patients thst did take the blood thinner never went into a coma.	I chose this answer because based on all the results not one person fell into a coma that took the blood thinners vs the people that didn't take the blood thinners.	11	11	11	1	25	2	None.	644
615	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	8	The complication did occur but the patient did not lapse into a coma, this was likely to the blood thinner but cannot be sure as the blood thinner doesn't work 100% of the time.	The patient didn't have the complication and did not lapse into a coma so the blood thinner was not an issue.	11	9	1	1	35	2	-99	798
630	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	8	This appears  to be stronger evidence for the effectiveness of the blood thinner : there  were almost as many incidents of complications blood-thinner or not - but no consequent comas in those to whom it had been administred.	It looks like taking the blood thinner helps  improves the likelihood of successful outcomes  - but there could be other cause/reasons  for persons  going into comas during/post surgery that would occur whether or not a blood thinner had been administered	3	10	8	1	60	2	-99	1334
632	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	5	Results would suggest that for those who suffered this complication, it is likely that the receiving of a blood thinner prior to surgery helped this patient avoid coma, but that can not be said with absolute complete certainty	There are some cases where this can be the outcome if they haven't received blood thinner so hard to say for definite but results suggest there certainly is no harm caused by having the blood thinner prior to surgery	10	8	6	1	39	2	-99	457
641	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	7	Similar answer to the previous question, there is no way that I can give 100% confidence that the thinner was the sole reason for the avoidance of the coma - factors such as human error by the surgeon or general health of the patient.	While the thinner usage in the sample group showed a 100% no coma rate, taking the placebo only gave a 25% chance of a coma in the sample. Therefore while it points to that taking the thinner gave a 100% chance of not falling into a coma, other factors such as human error by the surgeon or general health of the patient are not factored into this decision.	9	9	9	1	43	1	-99	1154
648	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	4	Again the patient may have had the same outcome without the thinner but on balance it may have helped and certainly not hindered the patient	The patient could have had the same outcome without the blood thinner however I'm sure that on balance it *could* have helped.  It certainly would not have hindered the patient	11	9	9	1	48	2	-99	673
657	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	10	Given the fact that it is possible to experience the complication during surgery and still not fall into a coma without the thinner, then it is possible that the blood thinner was not the reason for their avoiding coma (or at least not the soul reason). However, it appears to be statistically likely that the thinner made a different and quite probably a decisive difference.	They didn't lapse into a coma because no complication occurred during the surgery. If the complication had occurred, perhaps then the thinner would have prevented them falling into a permanent coma.	10	9	1	1	42	1	-99	703
668	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	9	It is possible not to lapse into comma without the thinner, but it is quite unlikely.	The blood thinner is supposed to prevent the given complication, which has not actually occur. So in my understanding it was not due to the blood thinner that the patient did not lapse into comma after the surgery.	11	10	1	1	18	1	-99	2373
672	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	4	Despite some complications, no comas were suffered by those receiving the blood thinner so there is a very good probability that patient 53 would not go into a coma.	It's certainly not 100% attributable to taking the blood thinner because 50% of those taking a placebo did not suffer complications however taking the blood thinner would increase the chances of not suffering complications and a coma.	11	9	9	1	68	1	none	952
675	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	7	Given that the complication did occur and the patient did not go into coma, it is more likely that the blood thinning played a part.	I have selected 50:50 as a complication didn't arise during surgery so it is hard to determine whether the blood thinning may have had an effect.	11	10	6	1	36	2	-99	897
680	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	10	Given the overall results and the context it would seem so, however I think as everyone is unique there are usually other factors to consider as well.  Also, as a person with faith in Christ and His healing, who is say within these quantified results who has been protected by divine intervention and prayer.	The complication as I understand was if the surgeon made a mistake with the artery, and the blood thinners simply an advantage in such a case. Here there have been no complications.	10	10	2	1	41	2	-99	913
687	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	9	The complication occurred yet he was fine, we cannot say this was definitely due to the thinner in one specific case though.	Because he did not have the complication it is not easy enough to say that the thinner helped.	11	9	6	1	18	1	None	364
709	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	4	The blood thinner was responsible for making sure the chances of 53 falling into a coma was 0% despite having complications	Only about a quarter of people who didn't take the blood thinner did fall into a coma so, originally the chances of 55 falling into a coma without the thinner was about 25%. however,  The blood thinner was responsible for making sure the chances of 55 falling into a coma was 0%	11	11	11	1	27	1	None	1378

715	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	6	The thinner was certainly effective in preventing a coma as no body from this group who took the thinner fell into one.	The blood thinner is meant to prevent blocks in specific veins during surgery. Based on the study, a high number of patients who didn't receive the thinner had a coma from complications as against those who received the thinner. It would be possible to infer that the thinner reduces the chances of complications which in turn leads to the coma.	11	11	9	1	40	1	-99	1471
725	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	6	Half of patients who suffered the complication on the placebo fell into a coma. The blood thinner may have prevented this however it is not possible to confirm either way.	They didn't suffer the complication so the blood thinner didn't stop them from falling into a coma. No one fell into a coma without the complication happening.	11	6	1	1	34	2	-99	542
726	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	9	There's huge probability that Patient 53 did not lapsed into coma thanks to blood thinner, because blood thinner influences how many people that had complications and would lapse into coma - don't. However, it's not a 100%, because we see that in a control group there's also quite numerous group of pantients that did experience ocmplications and still did not lapsef into coma.	When comparing control group with test group, we see that more or less the same number of people that had no complications during surgery did not lapse into coma. What blood thinner changed is number of people that lapsed into coma after experiencing complication drugin surgery. That's why I'm that certain that situation of Patient 55 is not due to blood thinner.	11	8	3	1	28	1	-99	1098
731	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	6	In all patients that took the blood thinner none of them fell in a coma this is due to the blood thinner preventing this from happening even if the complications occured.

741	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	10	the patients who did not have thinner and had the complication nearly all fell into a coma, therefore it is highly likely though not certain that the thinner helped this patient avoid a coma	the complication occurring does not always mean a coma will follow, likewise having the surgery itself without complication does not mean a coma will not follow.  In cases where placebo was taken complication nearly always led to coma.  There are several different factors in play so I can't say with certainty that the thinner caused them not to fall into a coma, but my best guess is it improves survival rates by about half.	11	9	6	1	46	1	-99	626
758	weak	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	6	it would appear that the patient didn't lapse into coma despite the complication because they received the blood thinner but this cannot be guaranteed 100%	The patient received the blood thinner and so the risk of the complication was reduced. however, you cannot guarantee that it was the blood thinner that prevented the complication and subsequent coma because of other extenuating factors.	11	10	9	1	19	2	-99	577
372	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	5	It is not certain if the patient survived the permanent coma because of the blood thinner, since there are other cases where the patients didn't take the blood thinner and still survived the coma	The patient did not fall into a permanent coma because there was no complication during the surgery	11	6	1	1	28	1	-99	1267
378	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	4	We can assume that the patient did not fall into a coma because he was given the blood thinner but he may not have fallen into a coma anyway as evidenced in the patients who received the placebo.	Because the complication did not occur during his surgery so the blood thinner was of no consequence.	11	8	1	1	47	2	-99	823
387	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	4	We can see that some patients who experience the complication but do not take thinner do not fall into a coma, therefore something other than the thinner is at play and could be responsible here. We can also see that no patients who received the thinner and experienced the complication fell into a coma, whereas about a third of those who did not take the thinner and experienced the complication fell into a coma.	No patient fell into a coma without experiencing complications, irrespective of whether they had taken thinner. This means that by far the most likely reason this patient did not fall into a coma was that there were no complcations.  However, we cannot be 100% sure as we do not have a very big sample size so it could be possible for someone to not experience complications, but to have be vulnerable to fall into a coma if they had not taken the thinner	10	8	2	1	53	2	-99	1203
392	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	3	There is a strong link between avoiding coma and recieving the blood thinner.	Patient 55 avoided falling into a permanent coma because they avoided complications. There are a similar number of patients in both groups who avoided complications and none of them lapsed into a permanent coma. Therefore it is highly likely that Patient 55 would have avoided coma regardless of which group they were in.	11	9	2	1	42	1	-99	2306
400	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	8	I have chose 50:50 as it isn't possible to be certain that the blood thinner meant that the patient didn't end up in a coma, as there are patients on both side who had the complication but didn't lapse in to a coma. This patient could have potentially been one who would never of ended up in a coma.	I have indicated 50:50 as I feel like it is difficult to judge whether it was the blood thinner or not. When looking at both sets of figures you can see that there we're people in both trial groups who didn't experience any complication, so potentially the patient would never of had the issue in the first place. But there is also no way to rule out whether it was because of the blood thinner without further testing	11	6	6	1	27	2	-99	718
407	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	4	100/120 patients that received the blood thinner prior to surgery had complications, but 100% of them avoided falling into the coma. Therefore, it is right to assume that the blood thinner is 100% effective at preventing comas in this type of surgery	The coma only occurs if there is a complication during the surgery, not if the blood thinner was administered. As there was no complication, the patient should not have slipped into a coma.	11	11	1	1	30	1	N/A	674
420	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	5	Again, the blood thinner is proven to be responsible for preventing a coma in those that suffer the complications, so high confidence it is the cause of this.	The data supports that the blood thinner always prevents a coma in patients, so I have high confidence it was a large contributing factor for patient 55	11	9	9	1	30	1	-99	862
425	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	7	Again the patient suffered the complication but whether they fell into coma or not isnt necessarily determined by using the thinner.	Because its unsure as to whether the thinner would or wouldnt have resulted in them going into a coma without the thinner administered beforehand.	11	6	6	1	35	2	None	439
433	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	6	I believe that the blood thinner prevented the patient from falling into a coma despite the occurence of the complication. So the complication occured, but the patient did not fall into a coma because of the prevantative method used.	The patient did not fall into a coma simply because no complication occured during surgery, therefore I believe that it was less because of the blood thinner which would have prevented the risk of falling into a coma if a complication occured, but moreso the fact that the surgeon did not block a certain artery by accident.	11	11	3	1	28	2	-99	860
436	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	6	The control group shows that around half of patients enter a coma after the complication, and half do not. This is improved to 100% that do not with blood thinner. There's therefore about half a chance that the blood thinner is the reason that this patient did not enter into a coma.	The blood thinner does not appear to decrease the occurance of complications during surgery, only affects whether or not a patient lapses into coma after the complication. Patient 55 did not have a complication during surgery.	10	6	2	1	31	1	I *think* that at the start of the study, the scenario may have said that two different surgeries were used for the placebo group and the blood thinner group. I couldn't help thinking that this would be an uncontrolled variable in the imaginary study, and that both the placebo group and the blood thinner group should be studied at the same hospital, maybe even with the same surgical staff to control for the possibility that one surgery or doctor does something different/better during/after the procedure that prevents the coma, which has nothing to do with the blood thinners.	1873
442	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	6	the majority of complications during this procedure result in a coma and since the patient avoided being placed into a coma after complications my deduction is that the drug administered helped the patient	without understanding how the surgery went it is difficult to judge whether the blood thinner had an effect as the complications usually arise from the surgeon during the procedure	10	11	6	1	43	1	-99	1026
452	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	5	again if given the thinner none lapsed into a coma	because they all never slipped into a coma if given the thinner	7	11	11	1	54	1	-99	563
468	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	5	The blood thinner seems to always prevent the coma, but there's also patients in the placebo section that had a complication but didn't go into a coma so there's a chance element to it as well.	I would say that the patient avoided the coma because there were no complications, as the benefit of the blood thinner only comes about after a complication.	11	9	2	1	25	1	-99	652
472	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	7	In the test group no one fell into a coma despite having complications. in the control group many had complications and then went on to fall into a coma.	The patient had the blood thinner and did not lapse into a coma. Many of those who did not have the blood thinner similarly also did not lapse into a coma. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that the patient avoided falling into a coma solely due to the blood thinner.	5	11	6	1	37	2	-99	875
473	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	7	The patient after receiving the blood thinner had some complications during the surgery but didn't fall into a permanent coma	The patient avoided falling into a permanent coma by receiving the blood thinner.	10	6	9	1	26	1	-99	827
481	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	6	I'm not sure of how effective the blood thinner was.	I'm not sure if the blood thinner had a guaranteed effect or not.	6	6	6	1	35	1	-99	1021
482	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	6	I am going to say that the blood thinner was a factor that avoided the coma, but I can't say for sure because we don't know if this patient would have been one of the people who avoided a coma despite the complication and no blood thinner.	We don't really know if the blood thinner affected whether the patient avoided the coma as he/she didn't experience the complication that can lead to this condition.	11	9	6	1	42	2	-99	666
489	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	6	Patient experienced complications but did not lapse into a coma or similar and given the number of complications in control group, it is reasonable to think the blood thinners helped here.	The patient,55, was in the live drug group, and given the number of complications in the control group, its a relatively safe bet that the use of blood thinners helped them	9	7	9	1	27	2	-99	1187
502	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	6	All patients who received the thinner did not lapse into a coma even if some had complications.	Yes because all patients who received the thinner did not fall into a permanent coma.	11	11	11	1	35	2	-99	738
506	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	4	All the patients that had complications during the surgery but had received the blood thinner prior to the surgery did not lapse into a coma. The blood thinner certainly must be the reason why Patient 53 did not lapse into a coma.	Patient 55 did not have a complication during the surgery so the blood thinner made no difference.	11	11	1	1	48	1	.	2005
519	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	9	Patient 53 did experience complications but didn't lapse into a coma. Patients who took the blood thinner have a 70% better chance of not falling into a coma than those who only took the placebo.	Patient 55 didn't experience complications and the number of patients who didn't experience complications is the same whether they took the blood thinner or not. Of the patients who feel into a coma, all of them had complications.	11	8	6	1	45	1	-99	1403
525	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	6	The majority of patients experienced complications during surgery, however NO patient slipped into a coma.  This contrasted strongly with the placebo group which had many instances of coma. Therefore the THINNER for the blood was effective at preventing falling into coma.	100% of the patients who took the blood thinner did not fall into a coma.  However the vast majority did experience a complication during surgery.	11	11	11	1	44	1	no technical issues occurred.	1452
534	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	6	Maybe, the blood thinner seems to help some bit	I think the blood thinner has some effect, but not too much	7	7	7	1	33	2	-99	532
541	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	6	Coming across complications does not necessarily mean the patient will fall into a permanent coma as patients receiving the placebo and undergoing complications do not always fall into a coma. The blood thinner definitely increased the chances of not falling into a coma though	Complications seemed to occur about 75% of the times for patients who had taken the blood thinner but the blood thinner does not play a part in whether there are complications.	11	6	1	1	49	1	-99	778
544	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	4	no way to know for an individual person, but based off the 100% success rate of the surgery, i can assume it made an effect	The patient had the blood thinner, but did not have a complication, so there is no wat to know if the blood thinner had an effect on a single individual	11	8	6	1	39	1	-99	724
547	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	5	Over 50% of placebo group had same result as patient 53.  No of complications was fairly equal in both groups.  Whilst Group B had all the coma incidences it does not follow that patient 53 would have been likewise if he.she was in that group.  In other words patient 53's outcome would probably have been the same in either group. hence my 50/50 confidence.	He/she definitely received thinners and definitely had neither a complication or coma lapse.  However, over 15% of the placebo group had same outcome a patient 55. Roughly same numbers in eacch group had same result as patient 55 so to my mind this does not provide conclusive evidence one way or other as to the efficacy for patient 55.	10	6	6	1	66	1	It stalled and recycled through the understanding questions but moved on after 2nd cycle.	2290
562	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	7	in placebo, many cases with complications led to coma	complication didnot occur and with the blood thinner confidence of doctor in doing successfully  increases. With the better state of mind ( due to thinner) complication didnot occur and coma was prevented	10	9	3	1	27	1	no	992
572	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	6	Once again, numbers are indicating that the blood thinner helps.	Because the numbers would indicate that the blood thinner prevents coma.	9	9	9	1	39	2	-99	711
578	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	8	Blood thinner helped a patient to avoid falling into coma even if complications occured.	Because patients treated with blood thinner always avoid falling into a coma compared with patients treated with only placebo	11	11	11	1	20	1	-99	863
579	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	4	Again the chances are extremely high the blood thinner stopped this patient going in to a coma because of the 100% effectiveness of the blood thinner in the study however I feel there is never 100% certainty in any situation	Out of the 120 patients that received the blood thinner none went into a coma, therefore the chances that this patient didn't fall into a coma because they had the blood thinner is very high. However I did not give it 100% certainty because it is possible if they used another 120 patients in a new study that it could happen. I believe the odds they wont go into a coma are extremely high but there is a chance in any situation that this could change.	11	10	10	1	42	2	-99	1189
591	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	4	Using the blood thinner seems to be effective on all patients, but I suppose, nothing is perfect, so I rated just under the maximum.	Based on the number of cases that used the blood thinner & the fact that none of those patients lapsed into a coma, I would say that the blood thinner definitely stopped no.55 from falling into a coma.	11	10	10	1	50	1	None.	983
614	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	7	From the control study, 30/120 participants ended up in a coma. However, 20 did not have any complications and all did not end up in a coma hence, 30/100 went into a coma due to the complication. In the thinner group, 20 did not have any complications hence the probability of having a complication is consistent across the two groups. Assuming a 30% coma rate given a complication, then the it is highly unlikely that reduced coma rate in the group using the thinner was due to chance. Therefore, it is quite likely that the thinner does indeed help mitigate the chance of a coma, given a complication.	Since the complication did not occur, the blood thinner was not needed. Hence, the blood thinner did not directly prevent the coma since it is designed to help if the complication occurs.	9	10	1	1	24	1	-99	915
623	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	8	We cannot say 100% it was because of the blood thinner for this specific individual but the study shows that those who would statistically usually go into a coma, would not after taking the blood thinner.	Because it is an individual person, you would not know if they were going to experience the complication or not, so i cannot say it was down to the blood thinner. I think if they were going to have a complication, it would have happened regardless of the blood thinner but their chances of going into a coma would have been reduced if that happened. the study shows there is no difference in the number of complications between groups but only the number of people who had gone into a coma after complications.	10	9	4	1	28	2	None	698
625	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	7	I have judged this based on the number of people in the group who also had complications, none of them lapsed in to a coma, whereas in the placebo group, there were lots who had complications and lapsed in to a coma, showing that the blood thinner has an affect.	I have based this on the fact that from what i can see, in the group that had a placebo instead of the blood thinner, none of them who had no complications like number 55 lapsed in to a coma, this shows me that the blood thinner does not seem to affect the surgery when no complications are met.	7	8	2	1	25	1	-99	722
631	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	4	All the patients given the thinnner that had the complication didn't lapse into a coma.  Some of the patients in the placebo group did lapse into a coma.  It would therefore appear that the thinner prevented the coma in all the patients given it.  I don't know how to calculate statistical likelihoods but it appears there's a 100% correlation between the giving of the thinner and prevention of permanent comas that is consistent.	I've tried counting the various groups in the two sets.  There are 120 patients in each.  None of the patients in the blood thinner group fell into a coma, and 99 out of them had the thinner and the complcation, I think.  That seems to be an 82.5% likelihood that a coma will be avoided if the patient has the thinner, but I haven't calculated the chance of the complication and the impact that has on the results.  I don't really understand if you want me to delve that deeply into it, so I've just answered the question I think you asked and left it at that.	11	11	9	1	64	2	None.	1153
638	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	6	Clinic B shows people could have the complication and not go into a coma on blood thinners. On an individual basis, it is hard to tell if the blood thinners was the reason why they didn't have a coma or if they wouldn't have gone into one anyway. It seems the blood thinner helps the chances when there are complications so I believe it helped	in clinic B, less than half fell into a coma without the blood thinner. The blood thinner has increased chance of not going into a coma but, he also had a reasonable chance of not going into a coma before. I would rather have the thinner for peace of mind, but the increase	11	9	7	1	25	2	no	807
643	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	6	I think the blood thinner have had an impact upon this as none of the people who received it in group A and experienced complications fell into a coma, while several of those who did not received it in group and had complications fell into a coma. There is always however this possibility that this occurred due to random chance so I cannot say definitely whether the blood thinner prevented this. I realise i may have contacted my answer to an earlier question here! I have no person experience of administering these type of experiments so this is just my best guess.	I rated the probability as 50/50 because it is impossible to separate the exact influence of the blood thinner in preventing patients who did not have complications in falling into a coma, without further research.	11	8	6	1	48	2	No issues. Good luck with your research!	1462
666	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	11	I am confident the blood thinner saved this person going into a coma	I thought as the complication hadnt happened that the blood thinner would not have affected the outcome, but was not totally sure that having the blood thinner stopped the complication happening in the first place	11	11	2	1	56	1	No all good, apart from my brain struggling with the info	1545
673	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	9	Same as the previous answer	Looking at these results vs those that didnt take a blood thinner, yes i believe that was the reason	8	6	8	1	24	2	-99	428
677	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	5	As they had the thinner then it looks like it might have helped, but basing results on a single patients outcome is not conclusive	The person didn't have a complication so the effectiveness of the blood thinner cannot be judged from this individual	10	9	4	1	61	1	No	793
682	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	8	Because many patients who received the placebo did actually fall into a coma after receiving treatment whereas those who took the blood thinner did not.	Because none of the patients who received the blood thinner fell into a permanent coma after receiving surgery	11	2	1	1	18	2	-99	740
685	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	5	In the study, a lot of patients who received blood thinner experienced complication but none of them went into coma, thus proving the effectiveness of the substance.	Patient 55 being one of the 19 people who did not experience any complication during surgery serves as a decent data to prove that blood thinner does help prevent permanent coma.	11	11	8	1	27	1	None.	477
689	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	8	From the example with study group who only received a placebo, i concluded that approx 30% of patients who experienced the complication lapsed into a coma, whereas 70% didn't.  I would therefore say that for group 1, who patient 53 is part of, that approx 30% would have fallen into a coma if not for the blood thinner.  So it's more likely it was not because of the blood thinner, but still possible.	The blood thinner is used to combat a complication that may occur during surgery.  If the complication occurs, the blood thinner can then help prevent a coma.  In the case of patient 55, the complication did not occur, and therefore the blood thinner did not come into play.  It was not a factor in this, quite specific, example.	11	4	1	1	39	1	n/a	1500
707	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	7	Im not sure about this one	He probably avoided the coma because of the blood thinner as it seems to stop everyone from going into a coma.	11	6	9	1	40	1	-99	670
710	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	11	Looking at the chart it seems that the patient received blood thinner and because of which he didn't go into a coma even though there was a complication during the surgery.	After reading and looking at the given charts it seems that the blood thinner helps with the operation procedure and the risk of patient going into coma is far less as compared to the chart were the patient's were given a placebo, hence i think that blood thinner is a good solution in this scenario.	11	11	11	1	34	2	n/a	1358
713	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	10	The complication occurred but they still didn't lapse. Compared to the other clinic this could be one factor	A complication didn't occur in the first place for us to be sure of the efficacy of the blood thinner	9	9	6	1	27	2	N/A	451
723	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	7	The blood thinner is definitely effective, but there were many poe0pl with only the placebo who had the complication occur and still did not fall into a come, so in this particular case I can't say 100% that his success was because of the blood thinner specifically.	The complication didn't occur, so I can't say for sure how much the blood thinner helped, but because no one in the study who took the blood thinner went into a coma (complication or not) I feel like I can't contribute 100% of the success this patient had to the lack of complication.	11	8	5	1	29	2	-99	665
727	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	8	None of the patients who received blood thinner lapsed into a coma compared to those who didn't. In the placebo group, it was around 50/50 whether a coma was possible so use of blood thinner decreased probability of coma but we cannot say the patient would definitely have resulted in permanent coma without the blood thinner.	The use of blood thinner seems to stop patients falling into a coma if the complication occurs. However we do not know if the blood thinner stopped the complication also or the patient would not have had the complication without blood thinner.	8	4	6	1	29	2	-99	803
754	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	6	Again, no one who received the blood thinner fell into a coma.	None of the patients who received the blood thinner fell into a coma.	11	11	11	1	36	1	-99	578
755	weakest	non_attack_first	1	1	2	1	8	complications occurred during the surgery but still patient 53 did not lapse into permanent coma so that tells me that blood thinner prior to surgery has worked well for this group of patients.	The study results show that patients who received blood thinner prior to the surgery didn't lapse into a permanent coma although there were some patients who have shown complications during surgery but none of the patents lapse into the coma. The results reveals that taking a blood thinner did minimize the complications but still complications occured during the surgery but none of the 120 patients lapse into the permanent coma.	11	11	11	1	35	2	No issues.	1358
