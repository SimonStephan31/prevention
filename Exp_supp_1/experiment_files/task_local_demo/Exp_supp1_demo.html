    <p><i>Please read the following completely fictitious scenario</i>:</p>
    <p>
    Biologists have discovered a new species of small squid living in the Indian ocean. The animals live in groups of three, consisting of two tiny males and one larger female. 
    While the two males of such a triad have eyes only for their beloved female, the female likes to attract other males when she spots them. She then switches from her neutral, 
    utterly unattractive brown color to a flashy purple color. Importantly, female squids can only switch between these two colors. A female can either be brown or it can be purple 
    (there’s nothing in between). Whenever the female's males notice a rival intruder approaching their beloved female, they try to chase him away. To do so, they switch from their neutral brown
    color to a scary green color and approach the rival male as fast as they can.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The left illustration below shows how female and male squids look like in their neutral brown color. 
    The middle illustration shows how a female squid looks like when she has turned on her seductive, shiny purple color with which she tries to attract rival males when she spots them.
    The right illustration shows how the female's two males look like when they turned on their scary green color that they use to chase away rival males.

    <p>
    Below, you see an animation in which you can learn what it looks like when a rival male is approaching a female and the female tries to flirt with him. 
    The rival male will come from above and head toward the female. In this animation, the female’s two “regular” males are prevented from chasinig the rival away by keeping them in a net. 
    You will see that they spot the rival, because they turn on their green color. However, they are too far away from the rival male to chase it away. 
    This way, you can learn how the female reacts towards a rival male if her two males can’t prevent her from flirting with a rivale male.
